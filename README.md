## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @nearform/llm-chunk
```

## üî• Quick Start

```typescript
import split from '@nearform/llm-chunk'

const document = `Introduction paragraph explaining the core concepts.

Main analysis paragraph containing detailed technical information 
and comprehensive explanations of the methodology.

Conclusion paragraph summarizing key findings and recommendations.`

// Paragraph-aware chunking with precise overlap
const chunks = split(document, {
  chunkSize: 100, // Maximum 100 tokens per chunk
  chunkOverlap: 20, // Exactly 20 tokens overlap
  chunkStrategy: 'paragraph'
})

console.log(
  chunks.map(chunk => ({
    preview: chunk.text.slice(0, 60) + '...',
    tokens: chunk.text.split(/\s+/).length,
    position: `[${chunk.start}:${chunk.end}]`
  }))
)
```

## üìö Core API

### Primary Functions

#### `split(text, options?): ChunkResult[]`

**High-level chunking function that returns all chunks as an array.**

Processes input text using sophisticated algorithms to create optimally-sized chunks with precise overlap control. Automatically handles paragraph boundaries and provides rich metadata for each chunk.

```typescript
import split from '@nearform/llm-chunk'

const chunks = split(text, {
  chunkSize: 512,
  chunkOverlap: 50,
  chunkStrategy: 'paragraph',
  splitter: customTokenizer
})
```

#### `iterateChunks(text, options?): Generator<ChunkResult>`

**Memory-efficient generator for processing large documents.**

Provides lazy evaluation for memory-constrained environments or streaming workflows. Yields chunks one at a time without loading entire result set into memory.

```typescript
import { iterateChunks } from '@nearform/llm-chunk'

for (const chunk of iterateChunks(largeDocument, options)) {
  await processChunk(chunk)
}
```

#### `getChunk(text, start?, end?): string | string[]`

**Precise text extraction by character positions.**

Extracts text segments using absolute character positions, maintaining input type consistency. Essential for retrieving overlapped chunks and validating position accuracy.

```typescript
import { getChunk } from '@nearform/llm-chunk'

const extracted = getChunk(originalText, 100, 250)
// Returns exact text segment from positions 100-250
```

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### LLM Integration with tiktoken

```typescript
import split from '@nearform/llm-chunk'
import { get_encoding } from 'tiktoken'

// GPT-4 tokenization for production LLM workflows
const encoding = get_encoding('cl100k_base')
const tokenizer = (text: string) => {
  const tokens = encoding.encode(text)
  return tokens.map(token => encoding.decode([token]))
}

const chunks = split(document, {
  chunkSize: 4000, // Fits within GPT-4 context window
  chunkOverlap: 200, // Meaningful overlap for context
  splitter: tokenizer
})

encoding.free() // Clean up resources
```

### Array Processing for Multi-Document Workflows

```typescript
const documents = [
  'First document content with multiple paragraphs...',
  'Second document with different structure...',
  'Third document containing technical details...'
]

const chunks = split(documents, {
  chunkSize: 300,
  chunkOverlap: 30
})

// Each chunk.text maintains array structure
chunks.forEach(chunk => {
  if (Array.isArray(chunk.text)) {
    console.log(`Chunk spans ${chunk.text.length} documents`)
  }
})
```

### Streaming Large Documents

```typescript
import { iterateChunks } from '@nearform/llm-chunk'

async function processLargeDocument(text: string) {
  for (const chunk of iterateChunks(text, {
    chunkSize: 1000,
    chunkOverlap: 100
  })) {
    // Process chunks individually to manage memory
    const embedding = await generateEmbedding(chunk.text)
    await storeChunk(chunk, embedding)
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Algorithms

### Position-Accurate Overlap System

The library implements a sophisticated overlap calculation system that ensures perfect consistency between chunking and retrieval operations:

```typescript
// Binary search finds exact character positions for token counts
const overlapStart = calculateOverlapStart(
  originalText,
  previousChunk,
  tokenOverlap,
  splitter
)

// getChunk can retrieve overlapped content exactly
const overlappedText = getChunk(originalText, overlapStart, currentChunkEnd)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Retrieval Consistency**: Overlapped chunks can be extracted exactly using character positions
- **Token Precision**: Achieves target token counts within ¬±1-2 tokens
- **Boundary Respect**: Aligns with meaningful token boundaries when possible
- **Whitespace Handling**: Includes necessary whitespace for precise token counts

### Intelligent Paragraph Processing

The chunking engine uses a greedy algorithm with smart fallback strategies:

1. **Greedy Expansion**: Includes as many complete paragraphs as possible per chunk
2. **Overflow Detection**: Identifies when paragraphs exceed chunk size limits
3. **Automatic Sub-chunking**: Breaks oversized paragraphs using position-accurate overlap
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains semantic flow across paragraph boundaries

```typescript
// Paragraph-aware processing with automatic fallback
while (paragraphIndex < totalParagraphs) {
  // Try to fit multiple paragraphs
  const candidateChunk = expandGreedily(paragraphs, currentIndex)

  if (tokenCount(candidateChunk) <= chunkSize) {
    yield candidateChunk
  } else {
    // Fall back to sub-chunking with position-accurate overlap
    yield * subChunkParagraph(oversizedParagraph, options)
  }
}
```

### Binary Search Optimization

Critical performance optimizations using binary search algorithms:

- **Chunk Boundary Detection**: Efficiently finds maximum text length within token constraints
- **Overlap Position Calculation**: Locates exact character positions for target token counts
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimizes string operations and temporary allocations
- **Convergence Guarantees**: Ensures algorithms terminate with optimal solutions

## üìã Configuration Options

### `SplitOptions` Interface

```typescript
interface SplitOptions {
  /** Maximum tokens per chunk (default: 512) */
  chunkSize?: number

  /** Exact tokens to overlap between chunks (default: 0) */
  chunkOverlap?: number

  /**
   * Custom tokenization function for counting and splitting.
   * MUST be lossless - concatenating returned tokens must recreate original text.
   */
  splitter?: (text: string) => string[]

  /** Chunking strategy - currently supports 'paragraph' (default) */
  chunkStrategy?: 'paragraph'
}
```

### `ChunkResult` Interface

```typescript
interface ChunkResult {
  /** Chunk content (string for text input, string[] for array input) */
  text: string | string[]

  /** Absolute starting character position in original text */
  start: number

  /** Absolute ending character position in original text */
  end: number
}
```

## üß™ Testing & Quality

The library includes comprehensive test coverage with 166+ test cases:

- **Algorithm Validation**: Verifies overlap precision and boundary detection
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests empty inputs, single characters, and boundary conditions
- **Integration Testing**: Validates tiktoken integration and real-world scenarios
- **Performance Regression**: Ensures algorithms maintain sub-linear complexity
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript type checking and interface validation

```bash
npm test              # Run full test suite
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests only
npm run check         # Lint, test, and format check
npm run build         # TypeScript compilation
```

## üöÄ Performance Characteristics

**Computational Complexity:**

- Chunking: O(n log k) where n = text length, k = average chunk size
- Overlap Calculation: O(log k) per chunk using binary search
- Memory Usage: O(1) constant memory with generator-based processing

**Benchmark Results:**

- ~1000 chunks/second for typical documents (tested on modern hardware)
- Minimal memory allocation through optimized string handling
- Sub-linear scaling for large documents with generator usage

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From v0.x to v1.x

The v1.x series introduces position-accurate overlap with breaking changes:

**Previous Approach (v0.x):**

```typescript
// Approximate paragraph-boundary-based overlap
chunkOverlap: 20 // Could result in 50+ token variance
```

**New Approach (v1.x):**

```typescript
// Precise token-based overlap with binary search
chunkOverlap: 20 // Results in exactly 20-22 token overlap
```

**Migration Steps:**

1. Update overlap expectations for increased precision
2. Verify that position-accurate overlap meets your use case requirements
3. Test with your specific tokenizer for optimal results
